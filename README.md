# Bubbler (Our take on Frogger)

Utilizing HTML5, Canvas, and Vanilla JavaScript, we developed an entirely new visual take on the classic arcade game, Frogger. While most of the functionality of the original game remains in tact, we wanted to create a more neutral user experience (less squishing of living things and death), while flexing our design muscles. The project is an exercise in prototypal inheritance and class structure, as well as understanding the impact of a perpetually refreshing DOM, due to the nature of requestAnimationFrame. The application is also fully tested, with every class receiving both unit and integration testing. Below, you will find the instructions for installing and running the game locally. Enjoy!

## Initial Setup

1 - Clone this directory down from github.

2 - From the command line, run 'npm install' to install your dependencies

3 - Run npm start to fire up the server 

4 - Enter your localhost port in the browser to begin playing the game.

## Run Tests in the Terminal

To run all the testing suite, type 'npm test' on the command line in the root directory for the game.
